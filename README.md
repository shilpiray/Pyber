# Pyber Analysis

*   From the bubble plot its clear Urban cities had large number of drivers and riders than rural areas. In rural areas there is no well-defined trend in relationship to average fare. This could be explained by the smaller number of drivers in rural areas. Even if we observe the pie charts, we can see there is only 2.6% of drivers in rural areas but its accounting for 6.8% of total fares.

*   The number of drivers increases with the city classification, the rural areas having least number of drivers per city and urban areas having more. There are however data points in urban areas where number of drivers per city same as rural cities. A more analysis is required to understand this trend.


*   The average fare is less in urban areas compare to suburban and rural areas. This could be because of large number of drivers in the urban areas. If we see the pie charts, we can observe that cities make up for 62.7% and 68.4% of total fare and rides respectively, but the number of drivers in the city is 80.9% of the total drivers. So, it is because of large number of drivers in these cities causing lower prices.
